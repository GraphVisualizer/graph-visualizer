# Graph Visualizer

The web app we created allows the user to create a graph of their choosing. Once they have done so, they can toggle over to the algorithms tab to simulate an algorithm on their graph, or gain information about their graph. Currently, the following are available to the users:

- An iterative simulation of DFS, BFS
- A list of the cut vertices of the graph (found with hopcroft-tarjan's biconnected components algorithm)
- A minimum spanning tree of the graph (found with kruskal's algorithm)

How to use:
1. cd into graph-visualizer
2. Run npm build then npm start
3. localhost will start running the app in your browser
